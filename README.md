# Disease Prediction Using Hybrid ML Models 🧠⚕️

This project aims to predict diseases using hybrid Machine Learning models that combine the power of multiple algorithms for higher accuracy.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Domain**: Healthcare / AI-ML
- **Objective**: Predict diseases based on patient symptoms using hybrid models
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Models Planned**: Decision Tree + SVM, Random Forest + Logistic Regression, and more

## 📅 Day-wise Progress

| Day | Task Completed |
|-----|----------------|
| 1   | Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) |
| 2+  | Coming soon: Feature selection, model building, evaluation |
